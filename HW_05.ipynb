    "For both datasets, all gain measures achieved nearly perfect training accuracy before pruning.  However, the entropy and gini gains consistently yielded lower test losses than the error-based gain, particularly in the `chess.csv` dataset (test loss ≈ 0.013 vs. 0.036 for error).  In `spam.csv`, the entropy gain produced the lowest training and test losses (train: 0.014 → 0.041; test: 0.118 -> 0.112 after pruning), showing that it captures class information most effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Across all settings, pruning slightly increased training loss (e.g., 0.000 → 0.004 for `chess.csv`, 0.014 → 0.041 for `spam.csv`) but consistently reduced test loss (e.g., 0.0142 -> 0.0134 for `chess.csv`, 0.1519 → 0.1119 for `spam.csv`).  This indicates that pruning successfully reduced overfitting and improved generalization. \n",
    " \n",
    "The non-pruned trees, especially for `spam.csv`, had very low training loss but relatively high test loss,  confirming classic overfitting behavior in unpruned decision trees.  \n",

    "**Solution:**\n",

    "\n",
    "The training loss decreased monotonically as the maximum tree depth increased from 1 to 15.\n",
    "This is expected because deeper trees have more capacity to fit the training data.\n",
    "The loss dropped sharply between depths 1 and 6, then decreased slowly after depth 10.\n",
    "Beyond depth 10, the loss approached nearly zero, indicating overfitting to the training set.\n",
